//The SSH agent ( ssh-agent ) is an SSH key manager that stores the SSH key in a process memory 
so that users can log into SSH servers without having to type the key's passphrase every time they authenticate with the server
~ ssh-agent bash

~ cp Ansible.pem ~/.ssh/

//ssh-add adds private key identities (from your ~/. ssh directory) to the authentication agent 
( ssh-agent ), so that the ssh agent can take care of the authentication for you, and you don't 
have type in passwords at the terminal

~ ssh-add ~/.ssh/Ansible.pem

run
//600 permissions means that only the owner of the file has full read and write access to it. Once a file permission is set to 600, no one else can access the file
~ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/Ansible.pem

755 means read and execute access for everyone and also write access for the owner of the file
~ chmod 755 ~/.ssh/
